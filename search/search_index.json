Generation menu To access the generation menu, click 'Interaction' in the left sidebar and select 'DiffusionModelling' from the 'Method' dropdown menu. The modifier has three run types: Generate : The primary function for structure generation using similarity kernels. Hydrogenate : Adds hydrogen atoms to the active structure. Relax : Uses a pretrained MACE force field to relax/optimize the active structure after hydrogenation. Clicking \"Run modifier\" will perform the selected action on the active structure. Generation Settings Num Steps : Controls diffusive steps taken during generation. Higher values result in slower generation. 50 is a good starting point. Atom Number : Can be static or determined dynamically based on the length of the guiding curve (see Guided Generation ). Select 'PerAngstrom' for dynamic atom number. Guiding Force Multiplier : Adjusts how strongly atoms are attracted to the guiding point cloud. Default of 1 works for simple tasks. Increase for more complicated guiding curves. Hydrogenate and Relax Settings These modes have just one parameter controlling the number of relaxation steps. Defaults are suitable for most uses. Guided Generation We can create structures with arbitrary shapes by providing a point cloud prior. To draw a guiding curve: Press x or the 'Draw' button to enter drawing mode. Click atoms to place guiding points. Create a curve by adding multiple points. Press x or the 'Draw' button to exit drawing mode. To modify the guiding curve, click a point to select it. Then you can move it with the on-screen controls. When a point is selected: Backspace deletes the point. d duplicates the point, inserting it between current and previous. To place free points in 3D space: Create a canvas using the Drawing option in the left sidebar. Now in drawing mode, points will snap to the canvas. To modify the canvas: Press f to enter canvas mode, where the canvas stays fixed as you move atoms with the mouse. Hold shift and scroll to resize the canvas and access movement controls.","title":"Using ZnDraw"},{"location":"tutorials/zndraw_integration/#using-moldiff-with-zndraw","text":"","title":"Using moldiff with ZnDraw"},{"location":"tutorials/zndraw_integration/#web-app","text":"This section describes how to generate structures using the online web app, hosted here .
